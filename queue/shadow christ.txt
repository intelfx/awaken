[Blasphemous transaction in which
a brainless human could get his
own mind and identity is just a
feary trip from the heaven of holy
ignorance to the hell of
atheistic omniscience.]

Leave me in hell

Rip out your shame, rebuild your vision
Feed only vice, make a decision
One-track dickhead believes in God
Let him just stay and choke with blood
The christianity of brain:
Adore your phantom walking slain
Then pray and from your brain abstain
Repent and swallow holy bane

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship

Now pray for me and pray to me
Pray for immortal enemy
Pray for temptation and the sin
Pray for the beast that I have been
Pray for me now, believe in lies
Pray for the dead who live in skies
There is no God forever more
There is no faith next to a whore

Mild,
One of those who confide
Never gave up to try
Always could justify

Attention... Attention.

Blind,
Searching for rest while died
Jesus is crucified
Bleeding to end of time

Salvation... Salvation.

Messiah,
Feeling weakness inside
What he could never hide
In spite of things he lied

Suggestion... Suggestion.

Mind,
Turning to mad at night
Fearful, pitiful cry
Earthborn sin won't die

Invention... Invention.

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship

For grace of people angels bleed
Convincing tricks religion feed
What's written in a holy book
Is not your way - just take a look
You see your wretched empty mind
You crave for purpose, cannot find
Unsatisfied, dwelling soul
Improve yourself and take control

(Why?) blind people follow you
(Why?) slavery's only true
(Find!) and tell me what to do
(Time!) time has come, failing you

(dumped fucker i'm your sorrow
seems there won't be your tomorrow
i will rape your holy mother
same awaits every another
mad messiah, ghost or saint
from their blood i'm making paint
[HALLELUJAH]
making paint of false salvation
where all people have sedation
scared, betrayed and undone
hanging on the cross the one
stupid shit is your religion
'cause it blames the men origin
[AETERNITAS]
meanly spreading your conviction
you impose on will restriction
there is no conceited liar
in the treat of a bonfire
rules are broken dead's god's son
of deceitful testimon)
[REQUIESCAT IN PACE]

Will deserves bliss, your weakness - blade
And with my force I make you fade
Destroy your heaven, those who bless
And never gather to a mass
The crutch is broken, churches burn
And to the ash religions turn
Descend to grave, believe me, know:
Your veil is here and you've to go

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship
