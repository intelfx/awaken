Rip out your shame and rebuild vision
Feed only vice, make a decision
One-track dickhead believes in God
Let him just stay and choke with blood
The christianity of brain:
Adore your phantom walking slain
Pray for forgiving in the fane
Repent and swallow holy bane

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship

Now pray for me and pray to me
Pray for immortal enemy
Pray for temptation and the sin
Pray for the beast that I have been
Pray for me now, believe in lies
Pray for the dead who live in skies
There is no God forever more
There is no faith next to a whore

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship

It is your fucking life
It is your endless strife
No hope can justify
Your lonely stupid worship

For grace of people angels bleed
Convincing tricks religion feed
What's written in a holy book
Is not your way - just take a look
You see your wretched empty mind
You crave for purpose, cannot find
Unsatisfied, dwelling soul
Improve yourself and take control
