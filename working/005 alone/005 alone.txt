I want to force you to think about your life...

I know memory is the only thing that remains after you

Whisper words into your brain
Now for me these things are plain
Try to think about your gain
When man was killed by deathly bane

Die die die die!
He's gonna die slowly!

Unexpected, he is dying
What's the outcome of his life?
A never-satisfied supplying
The needs of strongest of this world

He realized and tried to change
Accept the fight against his fate
But never got that he had drowned
In his destructive inbred trait

He wanted only to come clean
But had no friends - so stayed unclean
There was no one to take confession
He had to end up in depression

I remember how he cried
I remember what he said
I remember words forever
"I do not want to die alone!"

He understood he's gaping void
On the picture of mankind
Nobody seemingly had mourned
His life, his type, his deathly grind

He rushed to patch his faults of past
The bleeding soul detached fast
He thought he could rewrite his fate
But he is dead, it was too late

I remember how he cried
I remember what he said
I remember words forever
"I don't want to die alone!"

The subject is lying under ground in tomb
It is there so empty, and nothing's in bloom
Nobody cares about his doom
And no one could answer, whose is this tomb...

I remember how he cried
I remember what he said
I remember him forever
He just didn't want to die alone!
