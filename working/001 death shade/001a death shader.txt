The GPU shall die

I want it die I need its death
It hides behind the interface
I write aperture with no care
The code is wrong, so is hardware

Requests together I don't lace
The bus is full, no cache erase
Threads forewarn interrupts' pace
The overheat will take its place

I made first launch
I have the code
I break pipelines
I build its death

The core was fine but now it's not
Just more textures to rot
Discard and retransmit again:
No single bit nor clock for them

No more contexts I can't cast
The power source attempts its last
Able to stop, but killed instead
I rendered frame and now it's dead

I made first launch
I have the code
I break pipelines
I build its death
