I want you die I need your death
You hide in closet I'm your lead
I opened door I saw your face
It's broken, scared - just surface

I saw your eyes not on their place
Your soul is mine I want your grace
Your grace is mine, I need some place
I took some place I ripped your face

I made first kill
I reached the top
I rolled in cave
I saw death shade

You're not like me but one of us
I saw your life you was so fussed
Was able to help, but killed instead
I ate your head and now you're dead

I made first kill
I reached the top
I rolled in cave
I saw death shade
