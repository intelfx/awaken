I rise again
Above macabre sadness
I see a man
His life will end in time
The Angel of death
I have to cut his life
I can hear his breath
That thing I can't take

Feelings are lost
Death is my name
Why can't I take human breath?
I know
That I have
But I can't force myself

"Human has to die..."

Fallen angel
Down from skies to hell
A rise of anger
Results in downfall
Human life
Is no more of a value
Blood-stained knife
In my hand for a sin

Feelings are lost
Death is my name
Why can't I take human breath?
I know
That I have
Still I can't force myself

Horde of demons crowding around
My jaded soul becomes aground
They force me to commit a sin
They begin torture, begin to skin

And they cry
And they cry
And they cry
And they cry
Human has to die
Human has to die
Human has to die
Human has to die

Or I make kill or I die right now
Choice is small, I have to decide now
And if my soul was a bit more hard

And they cry
And they cry
And they cry
And they cry
Human has to die
Human has to die
Human has to die
Human has to die

Human blood is spilled
So I knew my guilt
Demons were quelled
For I've been compelled

I went beyond the edge
My heartbeat faltered
A murder is my pledge
The future altered

Not freak on a leash
I am free
And all of my opponents
Are supposed to be
Dead
