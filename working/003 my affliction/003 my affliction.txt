I want to say goodbye
To cleanse myself of lie
My soul is now just mine
I see the sun in shine

I thought I couldn't stop
To drag what I can't drop
I thought it was my top
But I was just a flop

Addiction - my
Affliction - just
Restriction - now
Conviction

No appreciate for life
It was my inner strife
My problems were so rife
Like cum in nigger's wife

Addiction - my
Affliction - just
Restriction - now
Conviction

I know there is no god
But never had I thought
I'm victim of a fraud
A drug's the thing I awed

Addiction - my
Affliction - just
Restriction - now
Conviction
