I want to say goodbye
To cleanse myself of lie
My soul is now just mine
I see the sun that shine

I thought I couldn't stop
To drag what I can't drop
I thought it was my top
I'm an infantile flop

Addiction - my
Affliction - just
Restriction - now
Conviction

I can't appreciate the life
That was my inner strife
My problems were so rife
Like cum in nigger's wife

Addiction - my
Affliction - just
Restriction - now
Conviction

I thought I was a god
But god I had not laud
I'm victim of a fraud
A drug, the thing I awed

Addiction - my
Affliction - just
Restriction - now
Conviction
