This world is killing me

LISTEN!!!!

Please, let me awaken
Blindness is forsaken
My life is mistaken
I want to awaken

I've realized that my eyes
Each day withess a stream of lies
Day in, day out, human dies
And other humans kill for price

Oh god!
I see!
Oh god!
This world is

Killing me (x6)

When I'm asleep I see creation
Warfare is burning every nation
Human souls without salvation
Hopeless cat before castration

I've opened eyes -- it was no dream
The world has drowned in silent scream
And I can't see a single beam
But I see pain, fire and steam

Oh god!
I see!
Oh god!
This world is

Killing me (x6)

The steam of souls rotting inside
I am so shocked, that can't make stride
No one in world now hasn't pride
But every man is greatly snide

I bring the gun along my head
For this reality is dead
Enough of scareful life I had
It seems some blood today will shed

Oh god!
I see!
Oh god!
This world is

Killing me (x6)

Gunshot!
