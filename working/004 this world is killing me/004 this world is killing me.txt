This world is killing me

LISTEN!!!!

Please, I want to awaken
Blindness is forsaken
My born was mistaken
Just let me to awaken

I want to think that our eyes
Have never seen the world that lies
A lot of people cries and dies
And human killing for the prize

Oh god!
I see!
Oh god!
This world is

Killing me (x6)

When I'm asleep I see creation
War's fire is burning every nation
A lot of souls can't find salvation
Like hoping cat before castration

I've opened eyes, that wasn't dream
The world has drowned in loud scream
And I can't see no one sun's beam
But I can see a lot dark steam

Oh god!
I see!
Oh god!
This world is

Killing me (x6)

That's steam of souls rotting inside
I am so shocked, that can't make stride
No one in world now hasn't pride
But every man is greatly snide

I bring the gun to the my head
You know, reality is wery dread
And I was scared, I've lied to bed
It seems some bled today will shed
