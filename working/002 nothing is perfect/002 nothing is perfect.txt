No more sorrow, no more lies
No more questions like a "why"
Don't deny that revolution
Was for you the best solution

You was bad, don't fade to black
Priests will cover all your back
You was wrong and don't deny
Now your sins are free to die

Nothing is perfect
That's what I say
Nothing is perfect
The law to obey

Priests will give all of themselves
Now I know you'll help yourselves
Or I'll burn you in the fire
That was biggest my desire

Nothing is perfect
That's what I say
Nothing is perfect
The law to obey

Not any priest is clearly good
I know one priest who fucked the food
And know one church where man and man
Have flown in sodomy edem

Don't trust whom not with you in peace
You have to listen just yourself!
